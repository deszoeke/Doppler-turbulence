# Doppler-turbulence
Methods for computing turbulence statistics from Doppler velocity measurements.

A diverse set of tools for measuring turbulence in the atmosphere, and maybe other fluids, 
especially using remotely sensed velocities,
with an aim toward automatic discernment of turbulence and large eddy velocities.
