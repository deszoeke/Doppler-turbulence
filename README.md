# Doppler-turbulence
## Methods for computing turbulence statistics from Doppler velocity measurements

This repository contains tools for measuring turbulence in the atmosphere, and maybe other fluids, 
especially using remotely sensed velocities.
It is meant to facilitate exchange and comparison of methods, 
developed for different velocity 
measurements by diverse instruments, and for different geophysical flows.
A further aim is to promote methods for the automatic discrimination of noise and 
discernment of turbulence and large eddy velocities.
